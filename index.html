  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m Dr. Connie Dibo â€” a medical doctor, digital health advocate, and purpose-driven program leader passionate about reimagining healthcare for underserved communities.</p>
    <p>With extensive years of experience spanning sexual and reproductive health, non-communicable diseases, and health system strengthening, I bring a unique blend of clinical knowledge and tech-savvy creativity. Iâ€™ve designed programs that empower women with autonomy, led national outreaches that reached thousands, and championed digital platforms that break stigma and barriers.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m most alive when Iâ€™m creating people-first solutions that blend innovation, compassion, and equity â€” and I believe healthcare should be as inclusive and intuitive as the tech we use every day.</p>

    <p>Technology is a language, and Iâ€™m learning to speak it fluently.</p>

    <h2>Interests:</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a big fan of tech that <em>actually</em> makes peopleâ€™s lives better â€” especially when it comes to healthcare. Nothing gets me more excited than taking big health challenges and finding smart, simple (and sometimes scrappy) solutions.</p>
    <p>Some of the things that spark my curiosity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Turning complex health info into accessible, youth-friendly tools</li>
      <li>Playing with data to find patterns that lead to better care</li>
      <li>Exploring AI in healthcare â€” yes, even the weird chatbot kind</li>
      <li>Building platforms that center womenâ€™s voices, needs, and choices</li>
      <li>Getting inspired by nature (most of my ideas happen on hikes!)</li>
      <li>And dreaming up a world where tech and care arenâ€™t just connected â€” theyâ€™re inseparable!</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Jojo Kenya</h3>
      <p>A WhatsApp-based SRHR consultation and contraceptive delivery service that has supported thousands of Kenyan youth with private, judgment-free access to reproductive health services.</p>
      <p><strong>My role:</strong> I helped shape the clinical pathways, led user research, and advocated for the inclusion of feminist, inclusive language that resonated with our audience.</p>
      <p>Jojo isnâ€™t just a platform â€” itâ€™s a promise of dignity and agency for young people navigating health in a digital world.</p>
